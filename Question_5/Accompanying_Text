# Sleep and exercise as determinants of physical health

This first section tests the theory whether sleep is a better determinant of good health than exercise is. Here we use the stress level as a proxy for level of well-being, with higher stress indicating worse health.

To do this, we compare through use of a heat map how exercise and sleep jointly affect stress. As can be seen, when sleep quality is poor stress generally tends to remain high. While when a person is very active, they still can have a high stress level. While not causal, this plot does point to a greater importance which should be placed on sleep over exercise.

# Sleep quality and weight gain

Moving onto an investigation of sleep quality and weight changes we see that the worse the quality of sleep, the greater the fluctuation in weight. This indicates that getting good sleep is crucial to keeping weight under control and staying healthy.

# Calorie surplus/deficit and exercise

This plot goes to show that while it is very important to exercise, the increased hunger one experiences due to strenuous work often causes overconsumption of calories. This should be viewed as a sign that while it is good and preferred to remain active, everything should be done in moderation. The higher stress levels (seen with the lighter colours on the plot) for very and moderately active observations also reaffirm the relationship that intense exercise also causes lots of stress.

# Conclusion

The plots demonstrated previously lead us to two important conclusions. Firstly, that sleep is very important, arguably more so than exercise. Both for control of stress and weight fluctuations.
Secondly, while exercise is important it should be done in moderation so as to not elevate stress levels and calories consumed unnecessarily.
