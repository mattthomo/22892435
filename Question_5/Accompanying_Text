# Sleep and exercise as determinants of physical health

This first section tests the theory whether sleep is a better determinant of good health than exercise is. Here we use the stress level as a proxy for level of well-being, with higher stress indicating worse health.

To do this, we compare through use of a heat map how exercise and sleep jointly affect stress. As can be seen, when sleep quality is poor stress generally tends to remain high. While when a person is very active, they still can have a high stress level. While not causal, this plot does point to a greater importance which should be placed on sleep over exercise.
