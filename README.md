Data Science Exam:
================

<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

# Introduction 

This README file sets out the main outputs (with some descriptions) of
my answers to the questions. I lay out each question in the same way,
starting with pulling the data into this file for the respective
questions. Thereafter, I reproduce my plots and tables created for each
question with a short description thereof in relation to the question.
All functions that are responsible for the data wrangling and plots are
saved in the respective code folders in each question, as well as having
duplicates saved in the code folder of the root directory (i.e.Â for the
main project).
