# #abstract: |
#   Abstract to be written here. The abstract should not be too long and should provide the reader with a good understanding what you are writing about. Academic papers are not like novels where you keep the reader in suspense. To be effective in getting others to read your paper, be as open and concise about your findings here as possible. Ideally, upon reading your abstract, the reader should feel he / she must read your paper in entirety.

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

This README file sets out the main outputs (with some descriptions) of my answers to the questions. I lay out each question in the same way, starting with pulling the data into this file for the respective questions. Thereafter, I reproduce my plots and tables created for each question with a short description thereof in relation to the question. All functions that are responsible for the data wrangling and plots are saved in the respective code folders in each question, as well as having duplicates saved in the code folder of the root directory (i.e. for the main project).

# Source functions

The following code sources all of the functions used in the paper. I have made copies from all of my individual code folders inside of each of my questions and pasted it into the code folder in my root so as to make it easier to call from this README file.

```{r Source all functions, echo=TRUE}
list.files('code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>%
    .[grepl('.R', .)] %>% 
    as.list() %>% 
    walk(~source(.))
```


# Question 1

## Source data and load necessary packages

The following code details how I sourced my data for question 1

```{r echo=TRUE}

Baby_Names <- read_rds("./data/US_Baby_names/Baby_Names_By_US_State.rds")
Top100Billboard <- read_rds("./data/US_Baby_names/charts.rds")
HBO_titles <- read_rds("./data/US_Baby_names/HBO_titles.rds")
HBO_credits <- read_rds("./data/US_Baby_names/HBO_credits.rds")
```

## Plot 1


# Question 2

## Source data and functions


```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Plot showing Metallica danceability difference between different recording types  \\label{Fig4}"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Question_2/output/fig4.png")
```



# Question 3

## Source data and functions

## Results

# Question 4

## Source data and functions

## Results

# Question 5

## Source data and functions

```{r Q5 data and functions}

# read in data

Health <- "./data/Health/HealthCare.csv" %>% 
    read_csv()

# call all functions saved in code folder

list.files('code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>%
    .[grepl('.R', .)] %>% 
    as.list() %>% 
    walk(~source(.))
```


## Results

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Heatmap showing the relationship between sleep and exercise on stress"}
plot_stress_exercise_sleep(Health)
```
